        <h1>THE BASICS</h1>
        <div class="firstcolumnmenu">
          <br/>
          <p>NY Coed Soccer is a recreational League and we hope players approach games in the correct spirit.
            <br/>
            <br/> The rules below provide a guide, that's all.
            <br/>
            <br/> If you have a question or a concern, please speak to the referee and/or the NY Coed representative at the field.
            <br/>
            <br/> Alternatively, please email us at info@nycoedsoccer.com.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>

        </div>
        <div class="secondcolumnmenu">
          <br/>
          <p>It’s recreational soccer. Yes, you want to win. But if it's a win-at-all-costs mentality then perhaps you're better
            suited to another League.
            <br/>
            <br/> We monitor yellow and red cards and this may affect a player and a team’s ability to register for future seasons.
            <br/>
            <br/> NY Coed has a zero tolerance for fighting and overly-aggressive behavior, be it physical or verbal. Players
            exhibiting such characteristics will be removed from the League - and in those instances the League’s decision
            will be final.
            <br/>

        <div class="firstcolumnmenu">
          <div class="accordionButton">Coed Indoor 4-and 5-a-side</div>
          <div class="accordionContent">PLEASE NOTE: The specifics of each location may affect individual rules. Below is a general overview. Referees
            and Field Reps will confirm the details at your location.
            <br/>
            <br/> Games will last 42 minutes, split into 21-minute halvdives with a break of one minute, unless otherwise advised.
            <br/>
            <br/> In games that are 5-versus-5 (including goalkeeper), 2 female players (excluding goalkeeper) are required on
            the outfield at all times.
            <br/>
            <br/> It is a hardwood floor, therefore sneakers are the recommended footwear. Shinguards are highly encouraged in
            all divisions of the League.
            <br/>
            <br/> Walls are in play though often one side of the gym will contain bleachers and it is from here players can sub
            in and sub out. Substitutions are unlimited.
            <br/>
            <br/> As the specifics will change from location to location, the use of walls and out-of-bounds will be explained
            prior to kick-off by the referee.
            <br/>
            <br/> The ball is allowed to go above head height during general play. However, should it touch one of the utilized
            walls above a certain height, then it will be deemed out of bounds. Play will then begin with a kick-in and opposition
            players should be at least five yards away from the kicker.
            <br/>
            <br/> If the ball touches the ceiling during general play, it will be deemed out of bounds. Play will re-start with
            a free-kick to the opposing team.
            <br/>
            <br/> Goalkeepers CANNOT pick the ball up from a deliberate pass-back from one of their own team.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <li>Goalkeepers must release the ball from their hands within 10 seconds. This is to guard against time-wasting.
              If the 'keeper fails to do so an indirect free-kick will be awarded.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <li>All players may enter the penalty area during general play but not during a goal-kick. Again, clarification
                will be provided prior to the game as to the penalty area.
                <br/>
                <br/> We are a little stricter than other Leagues about replacement rules. In part, it is to guard against teams
                bringing in ringers on any given week and thereby unbalancing the season.
                <br/>
                <br/> More importantly, it is to ensure that all registered and paid players have as much playing time as possible
                and are not short-changed by unregistered players.
                <br/>
                <br/> While the NY Coed representative in attendance will have a list of official players, we're not going perform
                a roll call prior to each game - we expect teams to enter into the general spirit of the League.
                <br/>
                <br/> If you believe the opposition are fielding illegal players, please advise the referee immediately - and
                "immediately" doesn't mean when you go a goal down. We will then double-check and confirm a player’s registration.
                <br
                />
                <br/> Should a team be short of players during any given week, they are allowed to bring in replacements to complement
                their roster. However, non-registered players are only to be brought in when rosters are severely depleted.
                And when we state "non-registered" we are referring to players not on your official roster. This may include
                outfield player(s) and/or goalkeepers.
                <br/>
                <br/> Replacements, when required, can come from other teams within the League, or players that are not registered
                with NY Coed Soccer. If the replacement is coming from outwith the League, he/she must be identified prior
                to kick-off. And please ensure he/she is wearing a similarly-colored shirt to that of your team.
                <br/>
                <br/> If a team has 7 or above registered players in attendance, NO non-registered players are allowed - unless
                those in attendance consist of 6 males & 1 female. Then a female sub is allowed.
                <br/>
                <br/> If a team has 6 registered players in attendance, they are allowed to add 1 sub. In the instance of 6 males
                being in attendance, a team can add 2 female players.
                <br/>
                <br/> If a team has 4-5 registered players, they are allowed to bring in additional non-registered players that
                will bring the roster in attendance to 6.
                <br/>
                <br/> If a team has 3 or less registered players, then unfortunately the game will be forfeited and the result
                recorded as a 3-0 loss. A scrimmage, however, will be arranged for those in attendance.

            only to be brought in when rosters are severely depleted. And when we state &quot;non-
            registered&quot; we are referring to players not on your official roster. This may include
            outfield player(s) and/or goalkeepers.
            <br/>
            <br/> Replacements, when required, can come from other teams within the League, or
            players that are not registered with NY Coed Soccer. If the replacement is coming
            from outwith the League, he/she must be identified prior to kick-off. And please
            ensure he/she is wearing a similarly-colored shirt to that of your team.
            <br/>
            <br/> If a team has 10 or above registered players in attendance, NO non-registered players are allowed - unless those in attendance consist of 9 males & 1 female. Then a female sub is allowed.
            <br/>
            <br/> If a team has 6-9 registered players, they are allowed to bring in additional non-registered players that will bring the roster in attendance to 10.
            <br/>
            <br/> If a team has 5 registered players, they are allowed to bring in 4 non-registered players.
            <br/>
            <br/> If a team has 4 or less registered players, then unfortunately the game will be forfeited and the result recorded as a 3-0 loss. A scrimmage, however, will be arranged for those in attendance.
